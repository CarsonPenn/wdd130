      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Provide information to educate the public on the benefits of white water rafting. 
        Leading them to book a rafting session for their group.</p>
      

  
      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>I anticipate that there will be several demographics, small groups including but not limited to, church youth/young adult groups,
         Boy Scouts of America troops, family reunion groups, and college students. By using warm and cool colors i hope to convey the thrill of 
        rafting while explaining what my company will do to ensure that their participants are safe.
      They want a fun and safe adventure.
      They have the need of my crew's expertice on the water and the proper equipment
      audience will access this site via desktop and laptop, eventually mobile when i have that figured out.</p>
