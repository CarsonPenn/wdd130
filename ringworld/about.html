    <h1 class="h2cu">It all started nearly a decade ago</h1>
    <h2 class="h2cu">When a couple of misfit friends would walk home from church...</h2>
    <p class="p-ab">Four friends who others might see as odd would walk home from church every week and  talk about some of their favorite super heroes and space wizards. Conversation would circle through classics like Lord of the Rings, Chronicles of Narnia and George Lucas' Star Wars amongst other wholesome and entertaining stories. Often they would speculate what they would do if they were in those worlds.</p>
    <p class="p-ab">Deciding that there weren't enough good stories out there we chose to come up with our own stories. We came of with dozens of stories and worlds sometimes based off of movies and books. Ranging from medieval to sci-fi we talked about stories and created characters that helped us feel brave, confident or strong. One of those stories is one we named Ring World. </p>
    <p class="p-ab">Since we first started coming up with stories for it nearly 10 years ago it's evolved to have many characters, stories spanning several decades, its own creation story, distinct civilizations and a unique style of story telling. </p>
