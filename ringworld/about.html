    <h1 class="h2cu">It all started nearly a decade ago</h1>
    <h2 class="h2cu">When a couple of misfit friends would walk home from church...</h2>
    <p class="p-ab">Four close friends would walk home from church and talk about the superhero stories and space wizards in the media coming out. All we wanted was more stories like the classic Lord of the Rings, Narnia, George Lucas' Star Wars and other wholesome and entertaining stories.</p>
    <p class="p-ab">Deciding that there weren't enough good stories out there we chose to come up wiht our own stories. We came up with dozens of stories and worlds from medival to space age the story of Ring World was our favorite. It's been a decade since we first thought it up but we've been writing down the stories that helped us through middle school and high school.</p>
