    <h2 class="h2i">Introduction</h2>
    <div class="box1">
        <p>This page was created as a way to share information about a fantasy story. As the stepping stone of hosting short stories and concept artwork.</p>
        <p><a class="inline" href="index.html">Link to page</a></p>
    </div>
    <h2 class="h2i">Audience</h2>
    <div class="box1">
    <p>The primary audience is friends and family who have already had some exposure to our stories by word of mouth. We want to show that we aren't blowing smoke when we say that we've been writing a story. Eventually i hope it will morph to a page that is sharing our stories with others outside of our personal circle. Other nerds who are looking for stories to read.</p>
    </div>
    <h2 class="h2i">Goals</h2>
    <div class="box1">
    <p>The goal of this was to create a visually apealing informational website about a fantasy world my friends and i wrote.</p>
    <p>We've never shared our stories online so we want top create a 'stories' page and put some of our short stories there.</p>
    </div>
    <h2 class="h2i">Design Process</h2>
    <div class="box1">
        <p>I wanted the color scheme to look like how phones and browsers do when they are on 'night mode.' I chose dark background colors and purples because of the low contrast with they dark grays i used. Purple is also an important color throughout the story so i thought that would be a fun similarity.</p>
        <p>I went through many revisions of wireframes before i made a decision for the <a class="inline"href="site-plan.html">site plan</a>, then i deviated in several places from those wireframes haha. Reason being i wanted this website to look simple, i didn't want to overshoot my skills or make 'Ring World' look like more than it acutally is.</p>
        <p>My biggest change is the <a class="inline" href="contactus.html">contact us page</a>, i switched the submission style and added different content</p>
    </div>
    <h2 class="h2i">Conclusion</h2>
    <div class="box1">
        <p>I learned a lot of lessons/principles during the learning, design, and creation process. One of the most impactful lessons is that 'I don't know what I don't know.' If I want to be the best version of myself I can't limit myself and not seek knowledge.</p>
        <p>I also learned that if I can't figure something out one way there are always other options, wether that be a friend, validator site or chat GPT haha.</p>
        <p>I learned that I can't put off my work, I have to be dedicated and finish the project as soon as I can.</p>
        <p>I learned to be willing to set my own interests aside and help classmates when they ask for it, similarly I learned that when classmates need help but won't accept my offer I need to mind my own business haha! I can let them be adults and help them if they ask.</p>
