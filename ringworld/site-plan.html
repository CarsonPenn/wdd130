          This new world was created with the yearnings within each of us in mingd. There might not be any Orcs or elves, Two Towers or volcanoes with ominous names. Heck, there isn't even a talking Lion. This story, this world, was created with adventure in mind and escape from the mundane world around us. It could be said that this world was created with YOU in mind. Because it was created with ME in mind. This emerging fantasy became and escape for me and my best friend in our hardest of times.

        <h3>Creation of the Rings</h3>
        <p>In the dark of the universe, a song, a dance...</p>
        <p>
          The dragons of creation called for their powers to create a world. To create a people. Each dragon singing their words, breathing their breath, beating their wings and exerting their will to create matter.Heat of Fire and cool of water clashed! Lighting and Earth cracked. Time and Space joined together. The Great Dragons united to create their new home and a home for their soon to be creations.
        </p>
        <p>Purpose of the Rings</p>
        <p>
          With their incredible powers they created the world, then they created man. The first men were strong and powerful with the energy of creation. Several generations passed and this energy faded. The Great Dragons deemed that in order to fulfill their creation men must have the power of the dragons. Tahu, the Dragon of Fire and the Leader of the Great Dragons formed a golden ring out of the fires of the earth and blessed it with a token of his power. Given to men they could now access the powers of the Dragons. In turn, each Dragon created rings derived from their elemental powers and abilities. Upon the birth of every child the dragons would send forth rings of Drago (Rings created by the power of the Dragons) to give every man and woman on earth a reflection of their power. Enabling Mankind to create and thrive.

          In mercy the Dragons created man. In continued mercy they created the Gorilla People and the Dragon People. They share one world and one purpose. To serve the Great Dragons and obtain the principles of purity and righteousness.Sharing a world Three times the size of our own, they create vast civilizations and achieve wonderful feats of architecture and become individual societies of justice and truth.
