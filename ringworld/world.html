    <p class="top-p">The Dragons of Creation formed the world and the peoples thereon. First the Humans, then turning a curse to a blessing, the Gorilla People, healing a plague they created the last species, the Dragon People. They share one world and one purpose. To serve the Great Dragons and obtain the principles of purity and righteousness.</p>
    <p class="top-p">Sharing a world like that of our own, they create vast civilizations and achieve wonderful feats of architecture, becoming individual societies of justice and truth. </p>
