  <p>NARRATOR:
    (Black screen with text; The sound of buzzing bees can be heard)
    According to all known laws
    of aviation,
     :
    there is no way a bee
    should be able to fly.
     :
    Its wings are too small to get
    its fat little body off the ground.
     :
    The bee, of course, flies anyway
     :
    because bees don't care
    what humans think is impossible.</p>

<div class="panel">
  <p>How should I start it?
    (Barry strikes a pose and wiggles his eyebrows)
    "You like jazz?"
    No, that's no good.
    (Vanessa is about to walk past Barry)
    Here she comes! Speak, you fool!
     :
    ...Hi!
    (Vanessa gasps and drops the dishes in fright and notices Barry on the
    counter)
     :
    I'm sorry.
    VANESSA:
    - You're talking.
    BARRY:
    - Yes, I know.
    VANESSA:
    (Pointing at Barry)
    You're talking!
    BARRY:
    I'm so sorry.
    VANESSA:
    No, it's OK. It's fine.
    I know I'm dreaming.
     :
    But I don't recall going to bed.
    BARRY:
    Well, I'm sure this
    is very disconcerting.
    VANESSA:
    This is a bit of a surprise to me.
    I mean, you're a bee!
    
    BARRY:
    I am. And I'm not supposed
    to be doing this,
    (Pointing to the living room where Ken tried to kill him last night)
    but they were all trying to kill me.
     :
    And if it wasn't for you...
     :
    I had to thank you.
    It's just how I was raised.
    (Vanessa stabs her hand with a fork to test whether she's dreaming or not)
     :
    That was a little weird.
    VANESSA:
    - I'm talking with a bee.
    BARRY:
    - Yeah.
    VANESSA:
    I'm talking to a bee.
    And the bee is talking to me!
    BARRY:
    I just want to say I'm grateful.
    I'll leave now.
    (Barry turns to leave)
    VANESSA:
    - Wait! How did you learn to do that?
    BARRY:
    (Flying back)
    - What?
    VANESSA:
    The talking...thing.
    BARRY:</p>

    Would you like some honey with that?
It is bee-approved. Don't forget these.
(There is a room in the shop where Barry does legal work for other animals.
He is currently talking with a Cow)
COW:
Milk, cream, cheese, it's all me.
And I don't see a nickel!
 :
Sometimes I just feel
like a piece of meat!
BARRY:
I had no idea.
VANESSA:
Barry, I'm sorry.
Have you got a moment?
BARRY:
Would you excuse me?
My mosquito associate will help you.
MOOSEBLOOD:
Sorry I'm late.
COW:
He's a lawyer too?

MOOSEBLOOD:
Ma'am, I was already a blood-sucking parasite.
All I needed was a briefcase.
VANESSA:
Have a great afternoon!
